## Application Overview

App Screenshot

## Main Features

## npm start

Run the app in the development mode by entering npm start in the terminal from the project directory. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode by running npm test. For more information about running tests, refer to the Running Tests section of the Create React App documentation.

## npm run build

Build the app for production to the build folder by running npm run build. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes for easier versioning.

## npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. Commands except eject will still function, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.
